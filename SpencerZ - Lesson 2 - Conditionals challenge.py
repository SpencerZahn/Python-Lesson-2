#When we run the below code, what will happen?
if 2 == 2:
    print ("I'll print!")

	# "I'll print!" will be printed.
	
#What happens when we run the below?

#How can we change the below code to get the phrase "Some number?" to print? How about "Biiiiiig number"?

	# To get it to print "Some number?", the number would need to be changed to a number between 5 and 11.
	# To get it to print "Biiiiiig number?", the number would need to be changed to a number above 10To get it to print "Some number?", the number would need to be changed to a number between 5 and 11..
