#Exercise 4: Please copy the link to your program and attach it for turn in. Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

width = 17
height = 12.0
#For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

#width//2
print (width // 2)
#Prints 8
#width/2.0
print (width / 2.0)
#Prints 8.5
#height/3
print (height / 3)
#Prints 4.0
#1 + 2 \* 5
print (1 + 2 \* 5)
#prints an error
